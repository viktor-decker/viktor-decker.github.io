<h3>_Published:_</h3><h3>**Life-Course Differences in Occupational Mobility Between Vocationally and Generally Trained Workers in Germany**</h3>

Vocational education is considered beneficial to young workers entering the labor market
but disadvantageous late in their careers. Many studies assume that late-career disadvantages stem
from lower levels of occupational mobility, but do not explicitly study this mechanism. This study is
the first to empirically assess whether and to what extent occupational mobility differs between
workers with a general education and those with vocational training and to examine how these
differences develop over workers’ life courses. Using multilevel linear probability models on panel
data spanning 36 years of labor market participation in Germany, we find that vocationally educated
workers are less mobile, but only in the first half of their careers. In the second half, mobility rates
for vocationally and generally trained workers converge. Our findings support earlier research that
links vocational education to less turbulent early careers. Yet, they do not support the notion of
late-career mobility disparities between workers with different types of training. Implications for
research on education-based differences in career outcomes are discussed.
