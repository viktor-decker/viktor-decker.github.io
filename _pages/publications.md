_Preparing for submission:_ **Closing the gap? The impact of further training for career inequality between workers with vocational and general education**

_Preparing for submission:_ **Understanding Differences in Employment Between Workers with Vocational and General Education over the Career**

_Accepted at Social Science Research:_ **How routine tasks affect labor market inequalities between vocational and tertiary graduates over the career**

How do routine tasks shape disparities in income and employment prospects between workers with vocational and tertiary educational qualifications? While existing research predominantly emphasizes skill differentials as the primary driver, this study proposes that group differences in the prevalence and returns to routine tasks contribute to existing disparities. Using decomposition methods on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and the BiBB/BAuA Employment Survey, we examine how compositional differences in routine task performance between vocational and tertiary graduates impact differences in labor market outcomes over individuals' careers. We find that vocationally trained workers tend to perform more routine tasks than their university-educated counterparts. This compositional difference explains part of the income gap but does not affect unemployment risk. While group-specific levels of routine task intensity remain relatively stable, the returns to these tasks diminish over the life course, contributing substantially to the widening income gap between vocational and tertiary graduates over their careers.

_Published:_ **Life-Course Differences in Occupational Mobility Between Vocationally and Generally Trained Workers in Germany**

Vocational education is considered beneficial to young workers entering the labor market
but disadvantageous late in their careers. Many studies assume that late-career disadvantages stem
from lower levels of occupational mobility, but do not explicitly study this mechanism. This study is
the first to empirically assess whether and to what extent occupational mobility differs between
workers with a general education and those with vocational training and to examine how these
differences develop over workers’ life courses. Using multilevel linear probability models on panel
data spanning 36 years of labor market participation in Germany, we find that vocationally educated
workers are less mobile, but only in the first half of their careers. In the second half, mobility rates
for vocationally and generally trained workers converge. Our findings support earlier research that
links vocational education to less turbulent early careers. Yet, they do not support the notion of
late-career mobility disparities between workers with different types of training. Implications for
research on education-based differences in career outcomes are discussed.
