This year I taught in the course Education and Work at University of Amsterdam. The course provides insights into dealing with emerging educational and work-related inequalities. Students investigate what the implications of education's growing importance mean for levels of inequality of opportunity in terms of social class, migration background and gender. Addressing challenges at family, organizational, urban, and societal levels, the course draws from sociology, economics, political science, and more, introducing students to key theories and debates.

In the past, I taught advanced statistics to undergraduate students at University of Amsterdam. During my studies at the Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology at University of Cologne I also taught advanced statistics as well as longitudinal data analysis.
