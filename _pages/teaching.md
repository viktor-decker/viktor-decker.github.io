This year I taught _Advance Statistics_ to Sociology Bachelor students at University of Amsterdam. It is a short intensive course that fouses on theory and application of multivariate OLS regression. If you don't find this very advanced, feel free to contact my employer and advocat for more stats. Previously I taught in the course _Education and Work_ at University of Amsterdam. The course provides insights into dealing with emerging educational and work-related inequalities. Students investigate what the implications of education's growing importance mean for levels of inequality of opportunity in terms of social class, migration background and gender.

I taught _Advanced Stats_ already in 2022 and 2023 and a similar course during my studies at University of Cologne. There, I also taught longitudinal data analysis for one year.
