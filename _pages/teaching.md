This year I taught in the course _Education and Work_ at University of Amsterdam (UvA). The course provides insights into dealing with emerging educational and work-related inequalities. Students investigate what the implications of education's growing importance mean for levels of inequality of opportunity in terms of social class, migration background and gender. Addressing challenges at family, organizational, urban, and societal levels, the course draws from sociology, economics, political science, and more, introducing students to key theories and debates.

In January 2024 I will return to tutoring in the course _Advanced StatisticsA. It is a short intensive course that fouses on theory and application of multivariate OLS regression. If you don't find this very advanced, feel free to contact my superiors and advocat for more stats :). I taught this course already in 2022 and 2023 and a similar one during my studies at University of Cologne. There, I also taught longitudinal data analysis for a year.
