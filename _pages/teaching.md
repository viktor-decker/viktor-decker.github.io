This year I taught **Advance Statistics** to Sociology Bachelor students at University of Amsterdam. It is a short intensive course that fouses on theory and application of multivariate OLS regression. If you don't find this very advanced, feel free to contact the programme coordinator and advocat for more stats. Previously I taught in the course **Education and Work** at University of Amsterdam. The course provides insights into dealing with emerging educational and work-related inequalities. Students investigate what the implications of education's growing importance mean for levels of inequality of opportunity in terms of social class, migration background and gender.

I taught **Advanced Statistics** already in 2022 and 2023 and a similar course during my studies at University of Cologne. There, I also taught **Longitudinal Data Analysis** for one year.
