This year, I taught **Advance Statistics** to Sociology Bachelor's students at the University of Amsterdam. The course is a short intensive module foused on the theory and application of multivariate OLS regression for data analysis.

Previously I taught **Education and Work**, a course examining emerging inequalities in education and the labor market. Students explored how the increasing importance of education affects inequality of opportunity across social class, migration background, and gender.

I also taught **Advanced Statistics** in 2022 and 2023 at the University of Amsterdam, as well as a similar course during my studies at the University of Cologne. There, I also co-taught **Advanced quantitative methods** in the Sociology Research Master program. The course focuses on techniques for analyzing multilevel and longitudinal data.
