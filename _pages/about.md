I am a sociology PhD student at University of Amsterdam, currently in my fourth year. I am interested in how education affects careers on the labor market and work in the project “From School to Career: Towards A Career Perspective on the Labor Market Returns to Education (CAREER)” where I examine just that. The project is headed by Thijs Bol. Together with our colleagues we aim to develop a better understanding of workers’ employment trajectories in the context of changing labour markets. My dissertation focuses particularly on the drivers of education-based career inequality such as differences in occupational mobility, task content, and further training. I am also interested in how technological change and characteristics of educational systems tip the scales.
